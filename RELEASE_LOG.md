# MFW release log

This is the canonical handoff log for development waves.

## 2026-09-30 — Repository consolidation

**Status:** repository consolidated

- Canonical repository established: `PetrFedin/MFW`
- Complete current product tree synchronized into `main`
- Included `mfw/`, `mfw-api/`, `mfw-native/`
- PostgreSQL migrations through `016_brand_cdp_state_machine.sql`
- Current owner/investor layer: Owner Control Tower
- Current CRM/CDP layer: journeys, incrementality, RFM, churn, CLV, acquisition economics
- Current Render live contour documented in `RENDER_STATE.md`
- Legacy Render services still source `PetrFedin/Moscow:mfw-app`; canonical replacement is `PetrFedin/MFW:main`

### Development continuation point

Next wave:

- ecosystem economics
- contribution margin
- LTV curves
- acquisition payback
- revenue share
- sponsor economics
- network effects
- opening/closing audience asset bridge
- 12/24/36 month scenarios

## Logging standard

Every meaningful development wave should add:

- date
- exact Git commit
- major features completed
- migrations added
- Render deploy ID/status
- verification performed
- unresolved blockers
- next continuation point
